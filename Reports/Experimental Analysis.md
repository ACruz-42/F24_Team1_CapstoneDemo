# Introduction

Start by revisiting your conceptual design and clearly identifying the most critical requirements and success criteria impacting your project's overall goals. Collaborate as a team to determine these critical aspects. It is recommended to obtain instructor approval to confirm that these identified criteria are appropriate and sufficient for thorough evaluation.
Clearly define the following aspects for each experiment:

-   **Purpose**:
- **Procedure**:
- **Data Collection**:
**Trials**:
**Potential Biases**:

# Motor Control
For each documented experiment, you must include:

1.  **Purpose and Justification**:
    
    -   Explain why the experiment was designed, and how it relates to your critical success criteria.
2.  **Detailed Procedure**:
    
    -   Outline clearly the methods used, ensuring another team could reproduce your experiment.
3.  **Expected Results**:
    
    -   State your initial hypothesis or expectations clearly before conducting experiments.
4.  **Actual Results**:
    
    -   Present data collected during the experiments in an organized, easy-to-interpret format (tables, graphs, charts).
5.  **Interpretation and Conclusions**:
    
    -   Provide a detailed analysis explaining the significance of the results.
    -   State whether results matched your expectations and explain any discrepancies.

When you have complete all of the experiments: clearly summarize whether your experiments demonstrated that your project meets the original success criteria outlined in your conceptual design. If success criteria were not met, discuss the reasons and outline steps for improvement.
