This directory includes the final poster made in LaTeX. 

poster_example_no_images.tex is the base poster template tex file with the images commented, so it can be easily used for reference.

To edit the poster in Overleaf, copy everything except the poster example.
Then in Overleaf settings, change the compiler from pdfLaTeX to LuaLaTeX.
If you'd like to look at the example instead of the actual poster, copy it instead.
