## Minutes 

### Dr. Rizvi meeting: 

We showed him the robot at the time. It worked well enough at the moment. 

 

### ECE/ME meeting: 

Competed in SECON. We had to do a huge pivot Thursday night. It worked well, but it was too bad of a pivot. We had to account for the PID not working due to the Arduino Mega processing in the interrupts not being fast enough. We tried and did implement a control loop based on the OTOS (IMU), but we didnâ€™t have enough time to set up final navigation. Something also went wrong with the Hall Effects. It was either bad back emf, or something with the grounding on the power board. 

 

### Next Meeting: 

We plan on working on the Experimental Analysis this week. We will plan out the experiments and degrees of success.
