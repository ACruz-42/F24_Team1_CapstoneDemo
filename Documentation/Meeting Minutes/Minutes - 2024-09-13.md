## Minutes 

Cooper made a presentation for the meeting 

Introduced everyone 

Next meeting with ME’s we will have a list of requirements needed for the robot 

ME team will invite ECE team to their Microsoft Teams page 

Talked about working on the project proposal 

Presented idea of using RGB Sensor/Camera for April Tags and Object Detection 

Using Computer Vision (CV) along with a pre-generated map to navigate 

April Tags and white tape lines can be used for localization and assigning names to containers 

Worked on the project proposal  

Project Proposal will be finished by Sunday afternoon 

## Kickoff Meeting with Rentschler 

Finished 1 month before the competition time and then extensive testing 

$2000 budget suggested

Focus on points in ranking from easiest to hardest to accomplish 

Dakota – EE, PCB, Microcontroller 

Alex – EE, Python, Microcontroller 

Sam – CompE, Robotics Competitions 

Sean – EE, Solidworks, CAD, VEX Robots Competitions, connections with ME 

Alejandro – EE, Power, PCB, Schematic Analysis 

Final reports at end of next semester can be pushed back due to competition timeline 

Materials can be ordered this semester 

Generally, most items will need to be finished with a month pushback time 

ROS can be used if its usefulness can outweigh its time cost 

Pytorch can be used for AI training 

Intel 3d cameras or some other 3d camera 

Depth cameras would be useful as well 

Machine learning - convolution or transformer neural networks
