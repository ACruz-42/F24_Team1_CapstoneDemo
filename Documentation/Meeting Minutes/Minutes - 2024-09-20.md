## Minutes 

Dr. Rizvi provided links to Quanser and QCar. We talked to him about requirements for sensing and mechanical applications. 
We mentioned the IEEE-SECON Discord and the changes to the CSC and the difference between the Astral Materials. 

He will let us have access to his lab to test algorithms on the cameras that are provided on his QCars 

ME Team ideas: either do a scoop or a continuous roller for pick up, and either do an internal storage or a sorting system. 

Next week we will have the proposal finished or mostly finished. The proposal will be submitted again on Sunday. 
The ME team will focus on how the sorting will work.
