## Minutes 

### IEEE Robot Update meeting: 

Advice regarding the PID implementation was discussed, and methods of improvement for translation, including speed profiles, were explored.

Sean got the general drivetrain and CSC arm cases to work consistently. The PID portion still needs work.

Dakota set up the power board and battery connections.

Sam has been refining his wall detection code.

Alex has been working through navigational test cases using position markers to see how the robot responds based on the Motor Control code.

 

### Next Meeting: 

Alex will continue to work with Sean on the interfacing between the Nano and Arduino to accurately move the robot around the board.

Sam will review the Nano and Arduino code to determine how the drivetrain functions could receive feedback during movement events.

Dakota will help Sean with PID implementation.

Sean will continue to work on proper PID implementation, including a speed profile for movement.
