Minutes by Dakota Moye 

## Minutes 

### Dr. Rizvi meeting: 

Talked about OTOS sensor findings 

The IMU is nonlinear, but has a LUT built-in to make it linear 

Kalman Filter has edge cases for accelerometer angle and the laser missing points 

Talked about camera findings 

Camera might need to not use an IR laser due to interference with game field IR camera 

 

### ME/ECE Team Meeting: 

Mentioned above IMU and Camera findings 

Talked about using Jetson for  

OTOS to Nano 

Camera to Nano 

 

Line Sensor being axed 

LiDAR to Mega 

LDR to Mega 

Hall Effect to Mega 

 

See about PID control on Arduino 

 

Sean talked about the requirements for the motors and whether they needed encoders or motor drivers. He also figured out limit switches are needed. 

 

### Next Meeting: 

Dakota will build schematics for sensors. 

Alex will be working on the sim in Godot. 

Sean will be picking out specific parts for all the ME motors. 

Alejandro will finalize the battery, buck converter, and build a schematic, likely on Sunday. 

Sam will be picking out a camera, with focus on stereo camera
