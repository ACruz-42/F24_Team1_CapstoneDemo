# SECON 2025 Hardware Competition Robot - TNTech Team

## Summary of Requirements

This repo provides the documents and reports written to produce the TNTech autonomous robot for the SECON 2025 Hardware Competition.
The following link goes to a video that shows a general overview of the requirements.

The robot needs to autonomously navigate the field, collect materials, sort materials, deposit materials, and deposit containers.

## Capabilities

As a high level overview, the robot will need to navigate to materials outside the cave and collect them.
They will be sorted and deposited into their designated containers, which will be held by the robot.
After collecting all materials outside the cave, the robot will enter the cave.
It will then navigate to and collect materials inside the cave.
These will also be sorted and deposited into their designated containers.
After collecting all materials inside the cave, the robot will exit the cave and move to the designated zone to deposit the containers.
Finally, the robot will place a team beacon into the beacon mast.

## Salient Outcomes

Robot hasn't been constructed yet.

## Project Demonstration & Images

Picture pending of 3d model.

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.

## Repo Organization

Give the layout of the repo and what can be found where. Make it easy on those who are interested by making the headings of the various things in this section clickable links to the relevant folder or file in the repo.

### Reports

[Link to Reports folder](https://github.com/ACruz-42/F24_Team1_CapstoneDemo/tree/a463979d4f1928be542ba7baea590573b307fce3/Reports)

This folder includes the Project Proposal, Conceptual Design, and Detail Design.

Project Proposal discusses the high-level problem, high-level solution, specifcations, constraints, and measurements of success.

Conceptual Design discusses the solution for each subsystem with each subsystem split appropriately.
It lists the team members who work on each subsystem.
There is a block diagram to show how the subsystems connect.
There is an operation flowchart to show how the robot should be interacted with by users.
There is a high level operation flowchart that shows the general actions for the robot.

Detail Design is split into a separate document for each subsystem.
Each Detail Design discusses how each subsystem will be constructed and implemented.

### Documentation

Documentation folder has only been used for electrical schematics and 3d models so far.

In the documentaion section information regarding the documentation that is required and how it should be organized is given.

### Software

No software has been written yet.

In the software directory of the repo information regarding how each team is expected to document software can be found.
